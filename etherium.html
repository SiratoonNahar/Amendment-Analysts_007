            <h1>About Ethereum</h1>
            <p>Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that uses ETH (also called Ether) to pay transaction fees (or “gas”). Developers can use Ethereum to run decentralized applications (dApps) and issue new crypto assets, known as Ethereum tokens.</p>

            <h2>What is Ethereum?</h2>
            <p>Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain that aims to become a global platform for decentralized applications and strives to enable users worldwide to write and run software resistant to censorship, downtime, and fraud. As the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation puts it, it "Is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games, and apps that can't steal your data or censor you." Ethereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin as of 2023 and a decentralized computing platform that can run a wide variety of applications — including a universe of decentralized finance (or DeFi) apps and services. This platform is powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used within the Ethereum network for various operations, making it an integral part of the system.</p>

        <div class="How-bitcoin-works">
            <h2>How does Ethereum work?</h2>
            <p>Ethereum operates through a blockchain network, which serves as a decentralized, immutable ledger to record transaction histories. At its core, it uses Ether (ETH), the platform's native digital currency, to enable computations and transaction validation within the ecosystem. In contrast to its predecessor, Bitcoin, Ethereum's blockchain aims to support a diverse range of applications on its network, from decentralized applications (DApps) to decentralized finance (DeFi) services. Initially using a proof-of-work (PoW) system, Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model with 'The Merge,' with the goal of enhancing efficiency and reducing environmental impact. Validators now stake ETH to secure the network, moving away from energy-intensive mining.</p>

        <div class="history">
            <h2>What is the history of Ethereum?</h2>
            <p>In 2013, a 19-year-old computer programmer (and Bitcoin Magazine co-founder) named Vitalik Buterin released a whitepaper proposing a highly flexible blockchain that could support virtually any kind of transaction. Buterin, along with other co-founders, including Gavin Wood, secured funding for the project with the sale of $18 million in pre-launch tokens in 2014. In July 2015, the first public version of the Ethereum blockchain was launched, and smart contract functionality began to roll out on the Ethereum blockchain. Since its launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, known as milestones, which improve the system's functionality, performance, and security. These upgrades are decided by consensus within the community and aim to represent the ongoing development and forward-thinking nature of the Ethereum project. In 2022, Ethereum went through a major upgrade, switching from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake to become a more secure and energy-efficient blockchain.</p>

        <div class="how-to-buy">
            <h2>How can I buy Ethereum?</h2>
            <p>Coinbase makes it easy and secure to stake your ETH. Through Coinbase's built-in staking feature, anyone can stake their ETH (as much or as little as you'd like) in just a few taps. In your Coinbase app, navigate to the ETH asset page. You'll see a prompt to stake your ETH. If you want to sell or send your ETH staked on Coinbase, you can do so by converting it to cbETH, Coinbase's Wrapped Staked ETH token. The price of cbETH is determined by the market and may lose value. cbETH is available in select regions.</p>
